                <h1>Car Comparisons</h1>
                <p>This webpage compares car makes, models and trims from the years 1941-present.
                    I utilized a vehicle database API to pull car information for the dropdown menus. 
                    The page was constructed with a responsive layout in mind for a better user 
                    experience across different devices. You can view the page 
                    <a href="projects/Car_Comparison/index.html" alt="Car comparison page">here.</a>

                <h1>The Apartment App</h1>
                <p>Using React, Express, Node.js, and MySQL as the stack, I deployed an apartment
                    complex site on a Raspberry Pi. The user may filter by certain criteria or choose
                    to see all remaining apartments. Implementing account creation, authentication,
                    and login sessions, the site allows users to reserve and unreserve rooms.

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hey there, I'm Sean. I began learning about HTML and CSS in April of 2017. I became more interested in web 
                    ment as I began creating a sample website. I decided I would like to make a career change and enter
                    the programming field as a web developer. I am now learning web develop- ment full time. I have completed a 
                    few projects in vanilla javascript and have now started learning React. Although my focus is Front-end 
                    development, I would like have some knowledge of the Back-end as well and therefore am teaching myself 
                    Node.js.  
                </p>

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                My primary way to wind down is Latin dancing. I have been dancing salsa and bachata four years now, and also currently 
                teach. In addition, I enjoy working on vehicles and would eventually like to have a project car.
                </p>
