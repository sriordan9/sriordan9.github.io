                <p>Hey there, I'm Sean. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of web development (and programming in general).
                    I began learning about HTML and CSS in April of 2017. I became more interested in web development as I began
                    creating a sample website. I decided I would like to make a career change and enter the programming field as a 
                    web developer. I am now learning how to include functionality in my sites through the use of Javascript.  
                </p>

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                My primary way to wind down is Latin dancing. I have been dancing salsa and bachata four years now, and also currently 
                teach. In addition, I enjoy working on vehicles and would eventually like to have a project car.
                </p>
